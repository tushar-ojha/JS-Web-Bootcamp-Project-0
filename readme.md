**We need to build ugly first in order to build beautiful later!**

Learnings from this project:

    - Before jumping on development, we must a layout of page into mind. In order to achieve this, we should think in direction of breaking page into logical divs and boxes.

    - All basic HTML elements and CSS properties.

    - While applying CSS, target one thing at a time, complete it, move to next element. If while fixing new element, old element gets disturbed, come back to old element and fix it. Iteration is in CSS also!

    - vertical align property.

    - Any dimention which we give in %age is relative to the size of container.

    - We should try to give dimentions in %age to keep things responsive and always give min and max height width along with that.

    - position: fixed keeps things fixed according to the viewport.

    - We can covert inline elements to block elements and vice versa.

    - To keep things side by side, we can change display property inline-block and adjust width accordingly to achieve the purpose.
